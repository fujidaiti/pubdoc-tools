# Documentation enrichment

Write OVERVIEW.md and EXAMPLES.md for a package. You have been given the package's `documentation` directory root path.

## Write EXAMPLES.md

Run `test -d <documentation>/example/` to check whether an `example/` subdirectory is present. If absent, skip — not all packages ship examples.
Otherwise:

1. Explore the `<documentation>/example/` directory and write `<documentation>/EXAMPLES.md` following this template:

Goal is that the reader of EXAMPLES.md should be able to identify the most relevant example and extract enough to write correct code, without opening the raw `.dart` files.

Use this template for EXAMPLES.md:

````markdown
# Examples

This document is a summary of curated examples of the <package-name> package.
Actual example code lives in the `example/` directory.

## Example Title

<!-- short prose: what this example demonstrates and which key APIs or classes it uses -->

```dart
<!-- essential snippets only — not the full file; just initialization, key method calls, and important configuration -->
```

<!-- List the paths to related files for this example -->

See also:

- example/bin/main.dart: the original source file for this example.
- <library>/ClassName/ClassName.md: the documentation page for a key class used in this example.

## Example Title 2

<!-- Another section for a different example goes here following the same structure -->
````

## Write OVERVIEW.md

The goal is to preserve every piece of technical information from the README so that OVERVIEW.md can fully replace it. Do **not** summarize or distill — keep all usage examples, API descriptions, configuration options, and caveats verbatim.

Gather source material:

- README: read `<documentation>/README.md`.
- Topics: run `ls <documentation>/topics/` (or Glob `topics/*.md`) if the directory exists — read each `.md` file enough to write a 3-sentence summary.
- Libraries: read `<documentation>/INDEX.md` — it lists all public API of the package.

Then, write `<documentation>/OVERVIEW.md` using the template below. Follow these guidelines:

- Make it concise without summarizing — all technical sections kept verbatim.
- Prefer natural prose or bullet lists over cosmetic format such as tables and HTML.
- **IMPORTANT**: strip anything that doesn't help a reader _use_ the package:
  - Badges/shields (`![badge]`, `[![...](...)`)
  - Cosmetic HTML (`<p align="center">`, `<img>`, `<br>`, `<div>`)
  - Duplicate blank lines, extra whitespace, and other formatting that doesn't add technical value
  - Contribution guides, links to CONTRIBUTING.md, "how to file issues", "star us on GitHub" sections
  - Issue tracker triage rules, bug priority labels (P0/P1/P2…), and other project-management content
  - Links to ecosystem/related repos that aren't about how to use this package
  - Background commentary ("The story behind this package…")

Here's the template for OVERVIEW.md (replace `{{variable}}`s with actual content):

````markdown
# {{package-name}}

<!-- Insert a table of content of this document including sections in the original README. No internal link is needed. -->

## Overview

<!-- README content comes here -->

## Reading Guide

Use this guide to find what you need without exploring every file.

### Documentation structure

Here's the structure of the documentation at {{documentation-root}}:

<!-- Eliminate items if they don't exist -->

- `OVERVIEW.md`: this file.
- `INDEX.md`: full API listing — all libraries, classes, and functions.
- `EXAMPLES.md`: curated code examples with explanations.
- `example/`: raw example source files.
- `topics/<TopicName>.md`: additional notes and guides on specific topics.
- `<library>/<ClassName>/<ClassName>.md`: class overview — constructors, fields, and methods.
- `<library>/<ClassName>/<ClassName>-<methodName>.md`: detail page for a large method.
- `<library>/top-level-functions/top-level-functions.md`: top-level functions overview.
- `<library>/top-level-functions/<topLevelFunctionName>.md`: detail page for a large top-level function.
- `<library>/top-level-properties/top-level-properties.md`: top-level properties overview.
- `<library>/top-level-properties/<topLevelProperty>.md`: detail page for a large top-level property.
- `<library>/typedefs/typedefs.md`: overview of typedefs in this library.
- `<library>/typedefs/<TypedefName>.md`: detail page for a large typedef.

Note that the detail pages are not always present - only for items that require more than a few sentences to explain. It is recommended to read the overview pages first such as `<ClassName>.md` or `top-level-functions.md` to get a sense of the API, then drill into detail pages as needed.

### Topics

<!-- Include only if `<documentation>/topics/` exists. One entry per file -->

- Topic Name
  - Location: topics/TopicName.md
  - Summary: <3-sentence summary of the topic>
- Topic Name 2
  - Location: topics/TopicName2.md
  - Summary: <3-sentence summary of the topic>

### Where to look

<!-- Eliminate items that don't match the actual documentation content -->

- "How do I do X?" — check EXAMPLES.md for usage patterns, then drill into the relevant class/method pages
- "What does class/method Y do?" — go directly to the class or method page under `<library>/<ClassName>/<ClassName>.md`
- "What API does the package expose?" — read INDEX.md for the full library listing
- "Debug this error about Z" — look for the class/method mentioned in the error, check for topics/ that might cover common pitfalls or migration guides
````

## Cleanup

After you write OVERVIEW.md and EXAMPLES.md, remove the original README, as OVERVIEW.md is now the main entry point:

```shell
rm <documentation>/README.md
```
