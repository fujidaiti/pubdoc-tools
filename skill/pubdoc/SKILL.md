description: Look up how a Dart/Flutter package works using version-accurate documentation generated from the project's actual dependencies. Use this skill whenever you need to understand a package API before writing code — don't rely on training knowledge, as APIs may have changed. This includes implementing features with a third-party package, debugging errors or stack traces involving one, looking up method signatures or class behavior, figuring out how to configure or integrate a package, or migrating/upgrading to a new version. If you're about to call into a package you're not 100% sure about, use this skill first.

# pubdoc

Answers questions about Dart/Flutter packages by generating version-accurate documentation and exploring it.

## Step 1: Prepare documentation

Run the prepare_documentation script:

```shell
dart ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/prepare_documentation.dart [--project <project-root>] <package-name1> <package-name2> ...
```

Read the JSON output:

```json
{
  "packages": {
    "dio": {
      "documentation": "/Users/you/.pubdoc/cache/dio/dio-5.3.x",
      "needsEnrichment": true
    }
  },
  "error": null
}
```

If `error` is non-null, see the Troubleshooting section below.

## Step 2: Enrich documentation (if needed)

For each package where `needsEnrichment == true`, spawn an enrichment subagent.
If multiple packages need enrichment, spawn them in parallel and wait for all to finish before continuing.

- Model: fast, low-latency (e.g., Claude Haiku)
- Permissions: allow to read/write files in `documentation` directory
- Pass: the package's `documentation` path and the project root
- Instructions: read and follow `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/agents/doc-enrichment.md`

Always use this prompt template:

```
Generate OVERVIEW.md and EXAMPLES.md for the package at <documentation-path>.
Read and follow this for additional instructions: ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/agents/doc-enrichment.md.
```

If you cannot spawn a subagent, check each package for a missing `OVERVIEW.md` and generate it yourself by following `agents/doc-enrichment.md`.

**IMPORTANT**: do not proceed to step 3 until enrichment is complete for all packages that need it.

## Step 3: Explore documentation

Spawn a subagent to delegate the exploration:

- Model: fast, low-latency (e.g., Claude Haiku)
- Permissions: read-only
- Pass: the query, per-package `documentation` paths from step 1, and the project root
- Instructions: read and follow `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/agents/doc-explorer.md`

If you can use a built-in read-only agent optimized for searching and analyzing codebases (e.g., Explore agent), use it here. If you cannot spawn a subagent, read and follow `agents/doc-explorer.md` yourself.

Always use this prompt template:

```
Read the package documentation and answer the query:

- Documentation: <documentation-path>
- Query: <describe what you want to know about the package>

Read and follow this for additional instructions: ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/agents/doc-explorer.md.
```

Wait for the findings, then use them to proceed with your task.

## Note on documentation access

Rely on the subagent's findings — do not read the documentation yourself unless the subagent's report is insufficient and further reading is clearly needed.

## Troubleshooting

### pubdoc not found

Install pubdoc as a global executable:

```shell
dart install pubdoc
```

### Non-empty `errors` array

When using `--json`, errors appear in the `errors` array of the JSON output rather than on stderr. Show the error messages to the user and stop.
