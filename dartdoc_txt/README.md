# dartdoc_txt

A Dart package that provides APIs to generate Markdown documentation from
Dart/Flutter packages, optimized for LLM consumption.

Unlike [dartdoc][] (which generates interactive HTML), dartdoc_txt reuses
dartdoc's analysis engine but produces structured, grep-friendly Markdown files
designed for language models to traverse and understand.

See the [example][] for usage details.

[example]: bin/dartdoc_txt.dart
