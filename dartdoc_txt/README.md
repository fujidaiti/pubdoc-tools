# dartdoc_txt

A CLI tool that generates Markdown documentation from Dart/Flutter packages,
optimized for LLM consumption.

Unlike [dartdoc][] (which generates interactive HTML), dartdoc_txt reuses
dartdoc's analysis engine but produces structured, grep-friendly Markdown files
designed for language models to traverse and understand.

[dartdoc]: https://pub.dev/packages/dartdoc

## Installation

> [!NOTE] Requires Dart SDK 3.10 or higher.

Use [dart install][] to globally activate the tool:

```shell
dart install dartdoc_txt
```

Then, dartdoc_txt will be available as the `dartdox` command in your terminal.

[dart install]: https://dart.dev/tools/dart-install

## Usage

Run `dart pub get` in the target package directory before running `dartdox`.
Otherwise, types from dependency packages appear as `dynamic` in the generated
documentation.

```
Usage: dartdox [options]

-i, --input (mandatory)      Input directory.
-o, --output (mandatory)     Output directory.
    --source-threshold       Max lines of source to embed inline (default: 10).
                             (defaults to "10")
    --[no-]include-source    Include source code snippets.
                             (defaults to on)
-h, --help                   Show usage information.
    --version                Print the tool version.
```
